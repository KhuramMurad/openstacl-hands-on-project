# OpenStack Hands-On Project

A comprehensive, step-by-step collection of hands-on labs for deploying, configuring, and managing an OpenStack cloud environment using TripleO, Heat, and the OpenShift/OC CLI. Whether youâ€™re just getting started with director-based deployments or diving into advanced networking, monitoring, and reliability, this repo walks you through exactly what you need to knowâ€”commands, templates, environment files, and best practices included.

## Overview

This repository is designed for DevOps and Cloud Engineers who want hands-on experience with:
- **Director-Based Deployments** (TripleO undercloud/overcloud)  
- **Identity & Environment Files** (undercloudrc, overcloudrc)  
- **Heat Orchestration Templates** & environment overrides  
- **Application Reliability** (liveness/readiness probes, autoscaling)  
- **Keystone Domains, Projects & Users**  
- **Quota Management & Custom Flavors**  
- **Monitoring & Logging** (Prometheus, Grafana, alerts)  
- **Networking with OpenStack Neutron & OVN**

Each lab is self-contained under `labs/lab-<n>/lab-<n>-README.md` with full commands, YAML snippets, and explanations.

## Prerequisites

- A running OpenStack **undercloud** (TripleO) and **overcloud**  
- `python-tripleoclient`, `openstackclient`, `oc` (OpenShift CLI)  
- `kubectl` (if testing on a Kubernetes-backed overcloud)  
- Access to the undercloud & overcloud endpoints (credentials in RC files)  
- Administrator (sudo) privileges on your lab host

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KhuramMurad/openstacl-hands-on-project.git
   cd openstacl-hands-on-project
````

2. **Browse the labs folder**
   Each lab directory contains a self-contained `README.md` with objectives, steps, and examples.

3. **Follow the instructions**
   Source your undercloud/overcloud RC files, apply templates, run `openstack` or `oc` commands, and verify results.

---

## How to Work Through the Labs

* **One lab at a time**: Read the objectives, prerequisites, and complete each task sequentially.
* **Verify results**: Use `openstack` or `oc` subcommands to ensure each resource is created and configured correctly.
* **Experiment & extend**: Change probe paths, flavor sizes, quotas, or network CIDRs to match your own environment.
